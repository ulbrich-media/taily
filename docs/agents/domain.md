# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/ADRs/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.
- Per-context `CONTEXT.md` files: `api/CONTEXT.md` for backend, `frontend/CONTEXT.md` for frontend.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a multi-context repo — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root points to per-context domain files:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md                     ← root index (to be created)
├── docs/ADRs/                         ← system-wide architectural decisions
├── api/
│   └── CONTEXT.md                     ← backend domain language (to be created)
└── frontend/
    └── CONTEXT.md                     ← frontend domain language (to be created)
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR in `docs/ADRs/`, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-002 (UI architecture approach) — but worth reopening because…_
